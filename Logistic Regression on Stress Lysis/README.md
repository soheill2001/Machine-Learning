# Stress Lysis Classification
This is a machine learning program that reads data from a CSV file and classifies them based on stress levels using logistic regression with gradient descent optimization.

The dataset used in this program contains information about the stress levels of individuals and their corresponding lysis rates. The goal is to build a model that can classify individuals into low, medium, or high stress levels based on the given input data.
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites
+ Python 3
+ NumPy
+ SciKit Learn
+ Matplotlib

This will read the data from the Stress-Lysis.csv file and display a scatter plot of the input data. It will then split the data into training and testing sets and use logistic regression with gradient descent optimization to classify the test data. Finally, it will display the accuracy of the model and the confusion matrix.
